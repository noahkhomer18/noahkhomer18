# About me — Noah Khomer

I bridge Computer Science and Project Management to build clear, reliable, human-centered software. I love taking complex ideas and turning them into simple, teachable systems—whether that’s a frontend experience, a workflow, or a study guide. I grew up in NYC, live in Dallas, and I care most about helping others win.
