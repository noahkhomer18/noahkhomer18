# Hi, I am Noah

I’ve been coding since I was 12. Along the way I’ve built countless projects while working full‑time for teams like Dunkin’, Sparkle Car Wash, Mile High Cuts, Blue Collar Marketing Group, and The Musicians Club. Many of those projects are becoming public here—this GitHub will be a living testament to my work. I love learning, and that drive led me to pursue a double major with multiple minors across Computer Science, Software Engineering, Business Administration, Information Systems, and Project Management. I pass on what I learn through my YouTube channel to help others across subjects, and I also support recent graduates and senior professionals with resume improvements that help them stand out. I do a lot, learn a lot, and then teach it so we all grow. Welcome to my GitHub—I hope you find something here that helps you. I’m fully authorized to work in the U.S., open to internships and roles. I grew up in NYC and now live in Dallas.

- Simple > clever; clarity beats complexity
- Ship small, iterate fast, keep quality high
