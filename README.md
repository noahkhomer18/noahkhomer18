## About

I’ve always believed the best way to master something is to teach it. Explaining concepts helps me understand them on a deeper level, and that mindset has kept me learning nonstop so I can teach even more to others in a simpler way.

What started as curiosity turned into a passion—and that drive led me to complete a double major in Computer Science (Software Engineering) and Business Administration (Project Management & Information Systems).

New York City raised me; Dallas, Texas is home. I’ve built websites, launched apps, created content, and helped students and professionals sharpen their resumes and online portfolios. I love helping others win—because giving knowledge always comes back as growth and community.

## Advice from Noah

In 2025 it’s a different world. The competition isn’t you vs. others—it’s you vs. your potential. Most people are stuck comparing or waiting for the “right moment.” Don’t. Build, learn, teach, repeat. You don’t need to be perfect—just keep showing up. That’s where growth happens.
